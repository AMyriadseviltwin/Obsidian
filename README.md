## How to use
### Step 1 - Install Obsidian
Go here -> [https://obsidian.md/] <- and click the bigass **"Get Obsidian"** button to install and setup the program.

### Step 2 - Clone the repository
Clone the repository using this URL: [https://github.com/AMyriad/Obsidian].

**IMPORTANT:** Pls stick to the "PC-View" branch. The branch labelled "GM-View" is for notes and other things I use in the campaign I'm running.

### Step 3 - Open the repository folder in Obsidian
In the Obsidian app, use the option **"Open folder as vault"** and select the folder for the repo you just downloaded as said vault. Then voila! You should now have access to the SRD :)
