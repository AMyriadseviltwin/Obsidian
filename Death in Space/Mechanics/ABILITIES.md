### Ability Checks

In Death in Space there are four abilities.


> **BODY (BDY)**

>
> *Used for:*
> Melee attacks, health, carry capacity, grabbing things, withstanding exposure.
>


> **MOTORICS (MOT)**
> Represents your speed, maneuverability, steadiness, awareness, and reaction speed.
>
> *Used for:*
> Defense Rating, non-firearm ranged attacks, dodging, perception, interfacing, stealth.
>


> **SAVVY (SVY)**
> Represents your mental ability, memory, willpower, insight, charisma, and piloting skills.
>
> *Used for:*

>


> **TECH (TEC)**
> Represents your skills with tech, identifying parts, using firearms, tinkering, salvaging.
>
> *Used for:*

>


Each character has an **Ability Score** for every ability, the value representing how good or bad they are in that specific ability. When a character has to resolve a situation where the outcome is uncertain (e.g. forcing open an airlock, holding onto a friend, spotting traps, etc.) the player rolls a **d20**.

Add the relevant **Ability Score** to the roll, and you will have the character's result.
If the result is *equal to or greater* than **12** (by default) the check succeeds, otherwise you fail the check.


**SETTING ABILITY SCORES**
New characters generate their Ability Scores by rolling 2d4, one at a time.
The result is the first roll minus the second. Rinse and repeat until all four abilities have a value.

You may assign any result to any ability after you've finished rolling.

> *Example*
> First roll = 1
> Second roll = 4
> Result = -3
>
