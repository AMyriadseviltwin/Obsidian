# Ability Checks

In Death in Space there are four abilities: **BODY (BDY)**, **DEXTERITY (DEX)**, **SAVVY (SVY)**, and **TECH (TEC)**. Whenever a character tries to do something where the outcome isn't guaranteed, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability score to the roll. If the result is *equal to or greater* than the check's [[GLOSSARY#DC|DC]], the roll succeeds. Otherwise, the check is failed.

Unlike other games, the default DC in Death in Space is 12.

### Setting Ability Scores
To roll for a new character's ability scores, **roll 2d4, one at a time**. The result is the **first roll minus the second**. Rinse and repeat the process until you have a result for all four abilities. You may assign results to any ability you choose after you've finished rolling.

Example
> Roll #1 = **3**
> Roll #2 = **2**
> Result = **1**
