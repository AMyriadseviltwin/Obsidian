# Setting Abilities

In Death in Space there are four abilities: **BODY (BDY)**, **DEXTERITY (DEX)**, **SAVVY (SVY)**, and **TECH (TEC)**. When player characters attempt to do something that needs a dice roll, roll a d20 and add your relevant ability score to the roll. 

To roll for a new character's ability scores, **roll 2d4, one at a time**. The result is the **first roll minus the second**. Then rinse and repeat until you have a result for all four abilities. If you wish, you may redistribute any roll to any stat after you've finished rolling.

Example 1:
	First roll = **4**
	Second roll = **2**
	Result = **2**

Example 2:
	First roll = **1**
	Second roll = **4**
	Result = **-3**
