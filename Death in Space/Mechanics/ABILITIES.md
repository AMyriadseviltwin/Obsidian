### Ability Checks

In Death in Space there are four abilities.


> **BODY (BDY)**
> Represents your raw muscle power, physical endurance, strength, instinct, and stamina.
>
> *Used for:*
> Melee attacks, health, carry capacity, grabbing things, withstanding exposure.
>


> **MOTORICS (MOT)**
> Represents your speed, maneuverability, steadiness, awareness, and reaction speed.
>
> *Used for:*
> Defense Rating, non-firearm ranged attacks, dodging, perception, interfacing, stealth.
>


> **SAVVY (SVY)**
> Represents your mental ability, memory, willpower, insight, charisma, and piloting skills.
>
> *Used for:*
> Morale, piloting spacecraft, recalling knowledge, conversing, psychological resistance.
>


> **TECH (TEC)**
> Represents your skills with tech, identifying parts, using firearms, tinkering, salvaging.
>
> *Used for:*
> Hacking, ranged attacks, repairing and dismantling, technical knowledge, crafting.
>


Each character has an **Ability Score** for every ability, the value representing how good or bad they are in that specific ability. When a character has to resolve a situation where the outcome is uncertain (e.g. forcing open an airlock, holding onto a friend, spotting traps, etc.) the player rolls a **d20**. This is known as an **Ability Check**

Add the relevant **Ability Score** to the roll, and you will have the character's result.
If the result is *equal to or greater* than **12** (by default) the check succeeds, otherwise you fail the check.

> *Example*
> You try to hack an airlock's control panel.
> Roll d20 + TEC
>


**SETTING ABILITY SCORES**
New characters generate their **Ability Scores** by rolling 2d4, one at a time.
The result is the first roll minus the second. Rinse and repeat until all four abilities have a value.

You may assign any result to any ability after you've finished rolling.

> *Example*
> First roll = 1
> Second roll = 4
> Result = -3
>

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Some situations or conditions may positively or negatively affect your **Ability Checks**. This is referred to as having an **Advantage** or a **Disadvantage** on the check, depending on whether your chances are bettered or worsened, respectively. In both cases, instead of rolling one d20 on the **Ability Check**, roll two d20s and inspect the two results.

> If you have Advantage, the highest number of the two dice rolls is your result.

> If you have Disadvantage, take the lower number of the two rolls as your result instead.

In cases where you have both **Advantage** and **Disadvantage**, simply roll one d20 as usual.

### Contested Rolls

If an attempted action involving an **Ability Check** is actively opposed with another check by someone or something else, the roll is **Contested**. In the event of a **Contested** roll, both parties make an **Ability Check** against one another. The side with the highest result succeeds. In the case of a tie, the initiating side succeeds.
