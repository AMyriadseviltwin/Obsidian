# Life

To understand life you must first understand what gives you life.

**Health Points (HP)** represent how much damage a body can physically take before dropping dead. All characters have a **Max HP** and **Current HP** value they must track while playing.




New characters begin with **1d8 + BDY/END** max HP


1d8 + BDY max health
12 + DEX defense rating





Humans have 6 bodyparts: head, torso, left/right arms, and left/right legs


d10
1-2 - Left leg
3-4 - Right leg
5 - Left arm
6 - Right arm
7-9 - Torso
10 - Head





# Survival

Human beings need 5 things to survive:

>* Food (organ, 5 steps)
>* Water (vial, 5 steps)
>* Sleep (battery, 3 steps)
>* Heat (thermometer, 5 steps)
>* Oxygen (air tank, 10 steps)



Heat
Heat is represented in 5 steps

5. Scalding - 60 to 100 degrees
4. Hot - 30 to 60 degrees
3. Temperate - 0 to 30 degrees
2. Cold - -30 to 0 degrees
1. Freezing - -30 to -100 degrees







Oxygen
Habitable environments (e.g. stations and spacecraft) supply an ample amount of oxygen.










# Death

In time you will meet death, just as those who came before you and those who came before them. When the time comes, know this.

### Critical State

Dropping to **zero** or less health instantly puts you into **critical state (crit)**.
While in **crit** you are unconscious, and cannot act or respond. You only see your life flashing before your eyes. 


and for all subsequent turns, make a BDY check **(** DC 12 **)**.
Failing the BDY check will lower your **crit level** by 1, while succeeding will raise it by 1.

When you first fall into **critical state**, you will be at **crit level 0**.
If you succeed the BDY check at **crit level +1**, your character will be stabilized, resting unconsciously at **1HP**.
If you fail the BDY check at **crit level -1**, your character will have finally met their end, being given one last moment of fleeting consciousness before experiencing **[[#DEATH]]**.

| {XXX} | DEAD | <-----> |  -1   | <-----> |    0     | <-----> |     +1      | <-----> | STABLE | {XXX} |
| :---: | :--: | :-----: | :---: | :-----: | :------: | :-----: | :---------: | :-----: | :----: | :---: |
| {XXX} | DEAD | <-----> | DYING | <-----> | CRITICAL | <-----> | STABILIZING | <-----> | STABLE | {XXX} |





































Life has three prerequisites: **Health Points**, **Limb Health**, and **Defense Rating**.

### Health Points
**Health Points** (**HP**) represents how much damage a thing can physically take before death.


### HP and DR
All creatures have **health point (HP)** and **defense rating (DR)** values.

> HP represents how much damage a thing can take before breaking or dying.

> DR represents how good a thing can prevent hits, whether by dodging the attack or by being too durable to be affected.

###### Starting values
New characters start with **1d8 maximum HP**. When you rest, you recover **1d8 + BDY**.
All characters have **12 + DEX DR** by default, without armor.
###### Critical state
When a creature drops to **zero HP or less**, they go into **critical state**. 

### Bodyparts
Creatures usually have **6** bodyparts: **two arms**, **two legs**, **torso**, and **head**. Taking damage 



**Limbs** (arms and legs) each have their own HP, totalling the creature's max HP.
This means **each limb's max HP is 1/4th the creature's max HP, rounded down**.

  **Example:**
- *Max HP:* 37
- *Limb Max HP:* 37 / 4 = 9.25 ≈ 9

Limbs are also harder to hit **(+1 DR)** with ranged attacks, owing to the skill needed to hit a specific bodypart.

**When a limb takes damage it does not affect the creature's max HP**. But if the limb's HP is reduced to zero, it becomes broken or **dismembered**.


### Dismemberment
While your limbs may be harder to hit, losing one will heavily cripple you!

> Losing an **arm** 




# Survival

Humans have 5 **basic needs** they require to survive:

>* Sleep
>* Food
>* Water
>* Oxygen
>* Temperature












Creating a temperature system for "Death in Space" to simulate temperature and its effects on player characters can add a compelling layer of survival mechanics to the game. Here’s a detailed system you can integrate into your TTRPG:


### Temperature System for Death in Space

#### 1. Temperature Tiers
Divide temperatures into five tiers, each representing a range of temperatures and associated effects:

1. **Extreme Cold** (-100°C to -30°C)
2. **Cold** (-30°C to 0°C)
3. **Temperate** (0°C to 30°C)
4. **Hot** (30°C to 60°C)
5. **Extreme Hot** (60°C to 150°C)

#### 2. Temperature Effects
Each tier has different effects on the player characters (PCs):

**Extreme Cold:**
- **Immediate Effect:** PCs must make a Fortitude save every hour (DC 15). Failure results in 1d6 cold damage.
- **Lingering Effect:** Movement speed is halved, disadvantage on Dexterity-based tasks.
- **Long-Term Effect:** After 24 hours, PCs gain a level of exhaustion.

**Cold:**
- **Immediate Effect:** PCs must make a Fortitude save every 4 hours (DC 12). Failure results in 1d4 cold damage.
- **Lingering Effect:** Slightly reduced agility (disadvantage on Dexterity-based skill checks).
- **Long-Term Effect:** After 48 hours, PCs gain a level of exhaustion.

**Temperate:**
- **Immediate Effect:** None.
- **Lingering Effect:** None.
- **Long-Term Effect:** None.

**Hot:**
- **Immediate Effect:** PCs must make a Fortitude save every 4 hours (DC 12). Failure results in 1d4 heat damage.
- **Lingering Effect:** Disadvantage on Constitution-based tasks.
- **Long-Term Effect:** After 48 hours, PCs gain a level of exhaustion.

**Extreme Hot:**
- **Immediate Effect:** PCs must make a Fortitude save every hour (DC 15). Failure results in 1d6 heat damage.
- **Lingering Effect:** Movement speed is halved, disadvantage on Strength-based tasks.
- **Long-Term Effect:** After 24 hours, PCs gain a level of exhaustion.

#### 3. Environmental Modifiers
Consider environmental factors that can modify temperature and effects:

- **Shelter:** Reduces the temperature tier by one level (e.g., Extreme Cold to Cold).
- **Clothing:** Appropriate clothing reduces the DC of saves by 5.
- **Fire/Heat Source:** In cold environments, a fire or heat source reduces the temperature tier by one level within a 10-foot radius.
- **Water:** In hot environments, access to water reduces the DC of saves by 5.

#### 4. Recovery
To recover from temperature effects:

- **Warmth/Cold Source:** Spend an hour in a controlled environment (e.g., a heated or cooled space) to negate immediate effects.
- **Rest:** A long rest in a safe environment negates one level of exhaustion caused by temperature effects.

#### 5. Roleplaying Effects
Incorporate roleplaying elements to enhance immersion:

- **Extreme Cold:** Describe chattering teeth, numb extremities, and the desperate need to find warmth.
- **Cold:** Mention shivering, the need to huddle together, and slower reflexes.
- **Hot:** Describe excessive sweating, thirst, and sluggishness.
- **Extreme Hot:** Mention searing heat, dizziness, and the constant need to find shade or cool off.

#### 6. Temperature Tracking
Use a simple tracking system for temperature:

- **Thermometer Readings:** Provide regular updates on the environmental temperature.
- **Character Sheets:** Add a section for temperature effects to track ongoing saves, damage, and exhaustion levels.

### Example Scenario
The players land on a frozen moon with temperatures at -50°C. They need to find shelter quickly. 

- **Immediate Effect:** They make a Fortitude save every hour (DC 15). 
- **Failure:** They take 1d6 cold damage.
- **Lingering Effect:** Their movement speed is halved.
- **Long-Term Effect:** After 24 hours, they gain a level of exhaustion.

If they find a cave (shelter), the temperature tier reduces to Cold, making survival easier.

This system provides a structured way to incorporate temperature into your game, adding depth and challenging the players to manage environmental hazards effectively.



Temperature (Hot +2, cold -2)
Food (Full +2, starving -2)
Water (Hydrated +2, dehydrated -2)
Sleep (Well-rested, deprived)
Oxygen (Breathing 7, suffocating 0)

2 systems

Proposal #1:

> Each limb has their own healthbar, totaling 1/4th max HP.
> Torso represents your actual max HP.
> Losing your head kills you instantly (lol)


Proposal #2:

> Each bodypart uses your actual max HP.
> Losing a limb subtracts 1/4th of your MAX HP (not current).
> Losing your head kills you instantly (lol)
