# Mechanics

Hacking has three prerequisites: **Hack Points**, **Hardware**, and **Hacks**.

### Hack Points
**Hack Points** (**HkP**) measure your character's technical ability and mental stamina.
A character's max **HkP** is equal to **2 + TEC**. If your **HkP** pool total is zero or less, you cannot perform hacks.

*You expend **HkP** by*:
> Executing Hacks — each base Hack costs **1 HkP**.
> Enhancing Hacks — spending additional **HkP** can magnify the effect of a **Hack**.
> Combining Hacks — execute two or more **Hacks** at once to combine their effects. 

### Hardware
All hackers need a **Hack Deck**. Beyond that, **Hacks** require either a *Cable Assembly* (for *WIRED* Hacks) or  *Signal Broadcaster* (for *Wireless Hacks*).

**HARDWARE**
> **Hack Deck** — Portable and modular computer, often scavengd or homemade. Usually brick-like and covered in ports of various sizes, but if you begin with a **Hack Deck** or build your own, you may decide however it looks.

> **Cable Assembly** — Tangled knot of cords and connectors to splice into control panels and system ports.

> **Signal Broadcaster** — An enormous brick of a device bristling with antennae. Able to send and receive signals strong enough to overcome the constant static.

| **ITEM**           | **CONDITION (BASE / MAX)** | **SLOTS** | **PRICE** |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | :-------: | --------: |
| Hack Deck          | 2 / 5                      |     2     |       300 |
| Cable Assembly     | 1 / 2                      |     1     |        15 |
| Signal Broadcaster | 1 / 2                      |    20     |       500 |

**REDUCING CONDITION**
If a **Hack** fails, roll to reduce condition. On a failed check, roll 1d6. On a 1, reduce condition by one tier.

**UPGRADING HARDWARE**
You can improve hardware’s condition above base, up to its max condition. To increase its condition, expend one component and spend 1d4 days modifying your kit.



### Acquiring New Hacks and Hardware
Characters can acquire **Hack Decks** using holos in some stores, craft one themselves, or end up with one as a part of their [[STARTING GEAR]]. In the case of the latter, that
