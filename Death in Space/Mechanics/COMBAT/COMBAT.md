# COMBAT ROUNDS

Combat is structured into rounds, representing about **10 seconds** of in-game time. In a round, each participant takes one turn, where they receive **3 Action Points** they may spend on a different **Actions**.

### Initiative
The one who initiates the conflict begins the first combat round. If unclear, determine randomly.






Much like other games, combat in Space is structured into rounds, where everyone involved in the fight takes 1 turn every round. Each round represents about 10 seconds of in-game time, meaning 1 minute = 10 rounds. On your turn, you have time to perform one and a half actions, and move up to 15 meters (3 tiles).



#### TL;DR
> Similar to other games, combat is based on rounds.
> Every participant gets one turn every round.
> An entire **round** lasts 10 in-game seconds, 10 rounds represent a minute.

> Each person involved has time for **one and a half actions**, and up to 15 meters of movement.
> The one who initiates the conflict begins the first round.

> When someone ends their turn they choose who goes next, be it ally or enemy. This process continues until everyone has acted once in the round, then the last person to act in the round chooses who starts the next one. They can choose themselves.

> Attacks are resolved by rolling a d20, and adding your BDY or TEC to the roll if it's a melee or ranged attack, respectively. If it's equal to or greater than the DR of the thing you're trying to hurt, the attack hits and you can proceed to roll for damage.
