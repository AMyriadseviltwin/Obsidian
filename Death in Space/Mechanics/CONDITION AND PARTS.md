# Condition

Nearly everything is patched up, fixed, or repurposed beyond recognition. The current state of objects are represented by their **Condition**. An object's **Maximum Condition** is mainly a measure of how technically sophisticated the object is; the more complex it is, the higher its condition can be.

> Any object too small to yield any salvage has no Condition value

> Weapons, electronics, and devices have a Condition value in the range of 1-5

> Spacecraft, small stations, and big machines have a Condition value in the range of 5-12




##### LOSING CONDITION
> Every time an object with a condition value - including spacecraft, stations, and their modules - is used in a stressful situation outside combat, roll 1d6.
  
-> On a 1, the object's condition is reduced by one.
 

> Roll for condition when using the object, spacecraft or station in an ability check, or when time is tight and success is crucial. For combat and hostile situations, roll afterwards.


##### BREAKING OBJECTS
> At zero condition, an object is **broken** and cannot be used until repaired.

> If a **station or spacecraft becomes broken**, either by  being reduced to zero condition or zero frame integrity, emergency power is enough to run life support, but not much more. All non-essential systems, such as the engine and modules, stop working.


##### SPARE PARTS
> Spare parts for repairs are divided into two categories: **components** and **vehicle parts**.

> **Components** are circuit boards, wires, or other small electronic parts that can be used to repair or build weapons and electronics. One unit of components takes up **one item slot**.

> **Vehicle parts** are larger parts and materials used to repair large broken structures such as spacecraft, stations, giant drills, satellites, and big drones. One unit of vehicle parts takes up **five item slots**.
