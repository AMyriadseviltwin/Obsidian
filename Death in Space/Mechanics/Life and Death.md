## Hit Points and Defense Ratings

All creatures have **hit point (HP)** and **defense rating (DR)** values.

> HP signifies how many hits the thing can take before breaking or dying.

> DR signifies how good the thing can prevent hits, whether by dodging the attack or being too durable to be affected.

New characters start with **1d8 maximum HP**. When you rest, you recover **1d8 + BDY**.
All characters have **12 + DEX DR** by default, without armor.
