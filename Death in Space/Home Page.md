# HOW TO USE

##### This is the home page. You can return to it any time with `Ctrl + H`

##### Everything you need can be found in the relevant folders:

> **Character Creation** - Contains everything you need to know about player characters and how to create your own. [[CREATING A CHARACTER|Click here to get started!]]


> **Character Sheets** - A whole folder you can dedicate to storing your characters. Comes with my best attempt at making a character sheet template in this program for you to copy and paste into new notes. Feel free to make as many as you like :)


> **Images** - The repository for all images and artwork used in this project. Nothing necessary to playing the game. Feel free to browse or ignore to your heart's content.


> **Mechanics** - The meat and potatoes of this SRD. From combat and survival to condition and repair mechanics, this is everything you need to know to play Death in Space.


> **Shopping** - Nearby market? Passing by a trade port? Here you'll find the standard pricing for most goods, materials, contracts, and cyberware.


> **World Info** - LORE. Here you can read about things people in the world of Space would consider common knowledge. Information on [[CORPORATIONS|factions]], [[THE TENEBRIS SYSTEM|locations]], and [[GLOSSARY|terminology]] f.ex. may be found here.


###### If this is your first time here, welcome! For the sake of understanding the world this game takes place in, I strongly recommend you first read the [[INTRODUCTION]].


######                      ...and have a lovely DEATH IN SPACE :}
