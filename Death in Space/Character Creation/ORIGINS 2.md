An origin can be anything from a bioengineered species to someone with opinions and a mohawk. Starting from our* description, decide on how you want to interpret yours and how you fit into the setting. Be creative!

Choose your origin or roll a d6 to choose on randomly. Then pick one of the two benefits.
ㅤ* The brief initial description in *italic* text is straight from the book. Everything after that is what I have written for the campaign, and to offer a bit more depth to these origins. Still, make your character based on these origins however you like :)

Carbon
- Artificial humans made from altered templates
- Grown in chamber-like exo-wombs offworld
- Bioengineered for living and working in space
- Lifespan kept short to prevent overcrowding
- No children. DNA too unstable.


Chrome
- Old AI, with free will and sentience (ability to alter its own code), placed in cybernetic bodies.
- Manufactured with an organic brain-like CPU and distributed nervous system that requires oxygen.
	(Made to let the AI think in a way machines never could, but limit them with the burden of being partially organic)
- Few of them around. Not many were made, and they're rarely produced.
- 


Punk
- Term for regular humans born and highly involved during the war, coined from old world texts.
- Most opposed the war, or fought with their life during it. All are stubborn survivors either way.
- Commonly found everywhere.


Solpod
