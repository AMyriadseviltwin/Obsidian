An origin can be anything from a bioengineered species to someone with opinions and a mohawk. Starting from our* description, decide on how you want to interpret yours and how you fit into the setting. Be creative!

Choose your origin or roll a d6 to choose on randomly. Then pick one of the two benefits.
ㅤ* The brief initial description in *italic* text is straight from the book. Everything after that is what I have written for the campaign, and to offer a bit more depth to these origins. Still, make your character based on these origins however you like :)

### 1. CARBON
> One of the great triumphs of genetics, the first "carbon-based replicants" were created in an old, mostly forgotten age. Carbons are artificial, genetically modified humans, grown in space-based "exo-womb" chambers. 


No childhood
Born already knowing things
Genes tailored for their job







### 2. CHROME
>  


Sentient AI, back from when true AI were still made
Limited by an organic body vessel like all other true AI



### 3. PUNK
> Coined from old world sayings, punks are commonly known as children of war - stubborn survivors. 


Term for those born during the war
Survivors - some winners, all losers



### 4. SOLPOD
> Nicknamed after the devices they carry with them through their voyages, solpods are often from an older time.


Old, old humans who have lived through most of their history in cryostasis



### 5. VELOCITY CURSED
> 


Victims of deep space, bad trips, or otherwise strange incidents
Reality Disassociation Syndrome, the diagnosis, is a widely known phenomenon



### 6. APOSTLE








Carbon
- Artificial humans made from altered templates
- Grown in chamber-like exo-wombs offworld
- Bioengineered for living and working in space
- Lifespan kept short to prevent overcrowding
- No children. DNA too unstable.


Chrome
- Old AI, with free will and sentience (ability to alter its own code), placed in cybernetic bodies.
- Manufactured with an organic brain-like CPU and distributed nervous system that requires oxygen.
	(Made to let the AI think in a way machines never could, but limit them with the burden of being partially organic)
- Few of them around. Not many were made, and they're rarely produced.
- 


Punk
- Term for regular humans born and highly involved during the war, coined from old world texts.
- Most opposed the war, or fought with their life during it. All are stubborn survivors either way.
- Commonly found everywhere.


Solpod
