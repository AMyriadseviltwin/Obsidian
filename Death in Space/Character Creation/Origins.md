Your origin is the base of your character. 


It rept can be be anything from a bioengineered species to someone with opinions and a mohawk.


Starting from our* description, decide on how you want to interpret yours and how you fit into the setting. Be creative!

Choose your origin or roll a d6 to choose on randomly. Then pick one of the two benefits.




# I - CARBON
> One of the great triumphs of genetics, the first "carbon-based replicants" were created in an old, mostly forgotten age. Carbons are artificial, genetically modified humans, grown in space-based "exo-womb" chambers. Despite the origins of their DNA, not everyone considers carbons to still be human. They don't experience youth or childhood, since they step out of their exo-womb already matured. They have no ancestors, nor heirs, as their DNA can't support reproduction.

**ENGINEERED LUNGS**
Use half oxygen compared to everyone else (one step for every two normal steps).

**GEARHEAD**
Repair twice as fast.








No childhood
Born already knowing things
Genes tailored for their job







# II - CHROME
>  


Sentient AI, back from when true AI were still made
Limited by an organic body vessel like all other true AI



# III - PUNK
> Coined from old world sayings, punks are  as children of war - stubborn survivors. 


Term for those born during the war
Survivors - some winners, all losers



# IV - SOLPOD
> Nicknamed after the devices they carry with them through their voyages, solpods are often from an older time.


Old, old humans who have lived through most of their history in cryostasis



# V - VELOCITY CURSED
> 


Victims of deep space, bad trips, or otherwise strange incidents
Reality Disassociation Syndrome, the diagnosis, is a widely known phenomenon



# VI - APOSTLE



Religious devotees of the void






Carbon
- Artificial humans made from altered templates
- Grown in chamber-like exo-wombs offworld
- Bioengineered for living and working in space
- Lifespan kept short to prevent overcrowding
- No children. DNA too unstable.


Chrome
- Old AI, with free will and sentience (ability to alter its own code), placed in cybernetic bodies.
- Manufactured with an organic brain-like CPU and distributed nervous system that requires oxygen.
	(Made to let the AI think in a way machines never could, but limit them with the burden of being partially organic)
- Few of them around. Not many were made, and they're rarely produced.
- 


Punk
- Term for regular humans born and highly involved during the war, coined from old world texts.
- Most opposed the war, or fought with their life during it. All are stubborn survivors either way.
- Commonly found everywhere.


Solpod
