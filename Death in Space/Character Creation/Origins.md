Your Origin is the core archetype of your character. It can be be anything from a bioengineered species to someone with opinions and a mohawk. Whatever your choice, it will have heavily affected your life up until this point. 




Choose your origin or roll a d6 to choose on randomly. Then pick one of the two benefits.




# I - CARBON

> *Grown in space-based exo-wombs. Short life spans. They live their lives offworld and are untroubled by the darkness of space. More comfortable in an EVA suit than out of one.*


> "Carbon-based replicants" was the official term scientists of the Old Age gave them. Artificial humans grown in space-based exo-wombs, Carbons are genetically engineered for a purpose. Engineers, technicians, laborers, most corporations that held investments in Carbon growers put them to use as grunts in their labor force. 
> 
And while most Carbons were laborers 



**ENGINEERED LUNGS**
Use half oxygen compared to everyone else (one step for every two normal steps).

**GEARHEAD**
Repair twice as fast.


# II - CHROME
> *Ancient AI placed in a body vessel of organic material. Part machine, but with an organic CPU and a distributed nervous system that requires oxygen.*

> The history between man and machine is remembered by few these days. But the echoes of their last conflict are still felt today




**NATIVE MACHINE**
You can converse with computers as if they were real people. Plug in and find a friend :)

**BODY BATTERY**
You can use your body to power one small electrical device, such as a hand-held item.

**INTEGRATED**
You begin with one condition 2 cyberware of your choosing integrated into your body. It does not take up a cyberware slot. Incredibly difficult to remove.


# III - PUNK

> *Rebellious and non-conformist with a long history. They have seen civilizations collapse, and others turn against each other.*

**STUBBORN**
You'd rather die than give up. Reroll any dice roll once per session.

**GREEN THUMB**
You know everything about plants and what to use them for. You start with a pocket greenhouse and some random seeds.

**CUSTOM-BUILT**


# IV - SOLPOD
> *Hibernating for decades, they only stay awake for short periods. They dedicate their lives to the scientific study of slow, cosmic phenomena.*

**LONG-LIVED**
You have an old and useful contact in every port.

**OLD TECH**
You have a portable hibernation pod. It can regenerate lost limbs, prevents aging and halts the need to eat. Powered by starlight.


# V - VELOCITY CURSED
> *Ill-fated ones that have started to lose their connection to reality. They shift and flicker in and out of spacetime with glitching faces.*



**FUTURE MEMORY**
You have already been here. Once per session, ask the GM for directions. Expect the answer to be as clear as your memory.

**POCKET WORLD**
You start with a portable non-phys server, housing a virtual reality where you store memories to connect the past and future of your life. Up to ten users can connect simultaneously.


# VI - APOSTLE
> *Robed nihility shamans, hidden behind masks, speaking through synthetic voice scramblers. They have seen visions of the edge of the universe.*



**VOICE OF THE VOID**
You can make nearby electronics emit static and crackling whispers. These voices may disorient, distract, or provide some otherwise useful effect. Be creative or confer with the GM to determine its effect.

**MASKED**
You have a mask that you can reshape during rest into the resemblance of another face or mask. At a distance, it fools most.
