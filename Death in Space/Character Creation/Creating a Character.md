**THE SANDS OF TIME** swirl in anticipation. Years ago - perhaps decades, perhaps, centuries - from nothing, you came into being. This world is vast. Society splintered by their own ambitions across a cold and distant sea of nothing. Now, just as this world shaped you throughout your years of life, you've now been charged with the power to shape it as well.

Will you live to rise in this great void, or, soundlessly screaming, bear alone a grave                                         *DEATH IN SPACE?*
