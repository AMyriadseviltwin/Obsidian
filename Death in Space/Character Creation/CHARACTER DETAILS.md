In addition to your Origin, you have a set of **Character Details** to help 



Consider your character, your creation, as an extension of you. They are yours to shape as you explore the harsh world of Space, just as their past shaped them.

Take inspiration from the tables below to give your character a **background**, **drive**, **looks**, and **past allegiance**.

Decide for yourself what you want to include, or roll a d20 to choose something at random.

## PAST ALLEGIANCE
Some still wear their war uniforms, while others do all they can to forget. Roll or decide your **allegiance** during the Gem War. Who are you today, and what happens when you are pushed about the past?

| 3      | **WINNING SIDE.** At the end of the Gem War, you happened to side with the winners. Working with [[CORPORATIONS#NANOTRASEN\|NanoTrasen]] earned you much prestige, but at a great cost.

| 4      | **LOSING SIDE.** Working for the losing side in the Gem War, death followed in your steps. Of all the comrades you've lost, you were one of the lucky ones.
