Consider your character, your creation, as an extension of you. They are yours to shape as you explore the harsh world of Space, just as their past shaped them.

Take inspiration from the tables below to give your character a **background**, **drive**, **looks**, and **past allegiance**. Decide for yourself what you want to include, or roll a d20 to choose something random. Then finally, give your character a **name**. It will not save them.

## Past Allegiance
Some still wear their war uniforms, while others do all they can to forget. Roll or decide your **allegiance** during the Gem War. Who are you today, and what happens when you are pushed about the past?

| **D6** |                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | **AN IDEA.** You held some value - faith, science, or something else - higher than war than war and strife. You made compromises but kept away from fighting. |
| 2      | **FAMILY.** You stayed with family and kin, defending your turf with tooth and claw.                                                                          |
| 3      | **WINNING SIDE.** You happened to side with the winners, but in the end, did you really win?                                                                  |
| 4      | **LOSING SIDE.** Working for the losing side, death followed in your steps. You were one of the lucky ones. You survived, but at great cost.                  |
| 5      | **THE CONTRACT.** As an opportunist, you swore allegiance to those who paid best.                                                                             |
| 6      | **NONE.** You sided only with yourself and avoided the war as well as you could.                                                                              |
