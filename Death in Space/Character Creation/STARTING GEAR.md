### Item Slots
Each and every character has an inventory with a limited amount of **Item Slots**. Items typically take up one **Item Slot**, but items that are especially large or heavy - such as armor, heavy weapons, and Vehicle Parts - may take up more slots.

However, small items (no larger than your hand) that are easy to stack or bundle together - such as bullets, magazines, and Components - may be grouped together in a single **Item Slot**. Items stacked in this way can hold no more than **12** of itself.

> Characters have 12 + BDY Item Slots by default
>


**CARRYING TOO MUCH**
Carrying more than 12 + BDY items imposes **Disadvantage** on all actions.
Carrying more than double that amount reduces speed to zero.

### Holocredits
**Holocredits**, or Holos, are the most common form of currency widely used throughout Space. They are stored digitally in a single, secure account held in the tiny pill-shaped **Datachip** implanted somewhere in your body (you may choose where, most are implanted in the wrist).

> New characters begin with 3d10 spare Holos.
