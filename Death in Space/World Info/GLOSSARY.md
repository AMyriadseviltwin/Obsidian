#### Baroxuldium
Element 146, commonly known as plasma. The substance notably has a deep-purple hue, is highly toxic to breathe, and in gaseous form has a high chance of igniting upon contact with oxygen. Despite being the most hazardous thing one could have on a space craft, Plasma gas is the most commonly used fuel source in space. Engines, welding tools, and some power generators depend on the gas to run - making it one of the most valuable resources in space.

A popular torture or execution method used by brutal crews, and prisons. Involves tying a person to a heavy tow-cable, looped through the ship, and pushing them out an airlock without protection.

[Inspired by a practice of old world sailors.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keelhauling)
