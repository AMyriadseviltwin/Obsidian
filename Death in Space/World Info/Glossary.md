#### Keelhauling
A popular torture or execution method used by the most brutal crews, or on the worst of criminals. Involves tying a person to a heavy tow-cable, looped through the ship, and pushing them out an airlock without protection. The person would then be dragged through space at a high speed from bow to stern, forced to feel the oxygen in their body expand and escape, their blood in their veins and the spit on their tongue bubble and boil in the vacuum, until they reach the airlock at the other side of the ship. [Inspired by a practice of old world sailors.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keelhauling)
