- Old AI, with free will and sentience (ability to alter its own code), placed in cybernetic bodies.
- Manufactured with an organic brain-like CPU and distributed nervous system that requires oxygen.
	(Made to let the AI think in a way machines never could, but limit them with the burden of being partially organic)
- Few of them around. Not many were made, and they're rarely produced.

Sentient AI, back from when true AI were still made
Limited by an organic body vessel like all other true AI
