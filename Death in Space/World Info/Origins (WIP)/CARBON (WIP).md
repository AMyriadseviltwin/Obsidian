> One of the great triumphs of genetics, the first "carbon-based replicants" were created in an old, mostly forgotten age. Carbons are artificial, genetically modified humans, grown in space-based "exo-womb" chambers. Despite the origins of their DNA, not everyone considers carbons to still be human. They don't experience youth or childhood, as they step out of the exo-womb already matured. They have no ancestors, nor heirs.




- Artificial humans made from altered templates
- Grown in chamber-like exo-wombs offworld
- Bioengineered for living and working in space
- Lifespan kept short to prevent overcrowding
- No children. DNA too unstable.
